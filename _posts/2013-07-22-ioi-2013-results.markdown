Our magnificent team have returned from the IOI with two bronze medals, after two tense contest days!

Both Tony and Logan have scored bronze medals, with Tony being very close to a silver. Byung-Hoon and Alan Ansell were both very close to medal potential, and we look forward to seeing what they will be doing in the future!
