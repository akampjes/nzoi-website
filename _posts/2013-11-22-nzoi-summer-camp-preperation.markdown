We are well in the midst of preparations for NZOI Summer Training Camp, and looking out for students to attend!

Secondary school students from all over New Zealand will soon be converging on Auckland, for the annual training and team selection camp. Students live at the prestigious Grafton Hall, and study at the magnificent AUT, and we thank our very generous hosts for the facilities they provide!
