The team of four is gathering in Auckland on July 2 for a pre-departure training camp. They will be working at a lab sponsored by AUT, and in addition to last minute practices, they will be meeting with many of our sponsors.
Internet NZ, Solnet, VendHQ and Orion Health have all helped make this year's trip to the IOI in Brisbane possible.

Three of the 4 team members are old hands with Tony Sun and Logan Glasson attending their 4th Olympiads and Alan Ansell attending his 2nd. New comer Byung Hoon Cho     is not completely a novice to the scientific Olympiads with an older brother making the Maths team this year.

The team are looking forward to the Brisbane competition with hope that all their hard work will reap rewards.
